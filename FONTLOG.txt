FONTLOG for the Asap fonts

This file provides detailed information on the Asap Font Software.
This information should be distributed along with the Asap fonts
and any derivative works.

Basic Font Information

Asap is a contemporary sans-serif family with subtle rounded corners. Designed by Pablo Cosgaya, Asap ("as soon as possible") there are 4 styles: Regular, Italic, Bold and Bold Italic. This family, specially developed for screen and desktop use, offers a standarised character width on all styles, which means lines of text remain the same length. This useful feature allows users to change type styles on-the-go without reflowing a text body. Asap is based on Ancha (designed by Pablo Cosgaya & Hector Gatti), and has been developed with the collaboration of Andres Torresi and Nicolas Silva.
